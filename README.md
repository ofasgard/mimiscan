# mimiscan

A proof-of-concept partial Mimikatz implementation written for Frida. Written to accompany my blog "Dumping Lsass with... Frida?", which you can find [here](https://please.donothack.us/blogs/mimikatz-frida-part-1). Meant to be used in conjunction with `frida-server`.

Usage:

```bash
$ python3 MimiScan.py 192.168.1.241
```
**Note**: This version of the project is the one referenced in the original blog. For the most recent updates and improvements to the tool, check out the main branch of this repository.
