# mimiscan

A proof-of-concept partial Mimikatz implementation written for Frida. Written to accompany my blog "Dumping Lsass with... Frida?", which you can find [here](https://please.donothack.us/blogs/mimikatz-frida-part-2). Meant to be used in conjunction with `frida-server`.

Usage:

```bash
$ python3 MimiScan.py 192.168.1.241
```
